# Pitch
Nathan: A spectre is haunting the world - the spectre of programming.      
Kaz: We're here to talk to you about the programming activity, where you will get to learn how to code like an expert hackerman.     
Ethan: You will learn how to code in Python, learn to make 3D and 2D games, learn how to build a website without the help of wix.com, and get Swedish fish!     
Kaz: You will not only learn programming, but we will also do projects. For the studious among you, we will write programs that make calculations faster than the blink of an eye. For the less studious among you, along with making games, we will write a program that floods kahoot.it with over 1,000 bots.        
Harper: We'll hope to see you there.
