Instructions to install python packages:     
First, install python3.     
Once you have python3 installed, make sure it's installed by going to the terminal and typing `python3 --version`     
If the result of that is less than 3.6 and larger than 3, please update python3. If the result is less than 3 or gives an error, the installation of python3 didn't work.    
Then install pip. Once pip is installed, go to the terminal and type: `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Everything else is trivial to install.
