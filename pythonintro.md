# An intro to python
Python is a great programming language for computer-based functions for many reasons. First of all, it is very simple, making it easy to learn and understand. There are still quite a few more reasons. Python is a "higher level" language which means it's easier to understand to the human. Most "lower level" languages are compiled, which means they are converted from human readable code, to machine language (which looks like gibberish). With python this all changes. Rather of using a compiler, the python application will run the code as it is, giving you the option of quickly changing the code. This is called and "interpreted" language. This makes it (python) a great, simple, language to learn. Finally,python is open source. This means the source code for python is out there online, free for anyone to look at it or contribute to it without first going through a paywall. This means that everyday, there are more and more libraries to make your code work better. Python today is used to develop AI interfaces, as it handles data very well. Python is also used in web development with add-ons like flask or django. Did you know that Instagram was built off of python using django? In fact, Spotify, Reddit, Netflix, and even much of Google is developed in python. Python is also used in a variety of creation apps like blender to help automation. This is why python is such a versatile coding language, and why we are going to teach it to you!
