# An intro to python
Python is a great programming language for computer-based functions for many reasons. First of all, it is very simple, making it easy to learn and understand. There are still quite a few more reasons. Have you ever thought that your computer is slow? Often times, programming languages need to be compiled before they can be run, which is like converting it to symbols and numbers the computer can understand. This takes time, especially if you have that slow computer. By the end of your career, you'll be thinking "Ah crud. Just hurry up, would you?". With python this all changes. Instead of using a compiler, the python application will run the code as it is, giving you the option of quickly changing the code. This makes it a great, quick,, language to learn. Finally, anyone can contribute to the python project. This means that everyday, there are more and more libraries to make your code work better. Python today is used to develope AI interfaces today, as it provides a good and simple machine learning environment. This is just one of te many use cases.
