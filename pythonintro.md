# An intro to python
Python is a great programming language for computer-based functions for many reasons. First of all, it is very simple, making it easy to learn and understand. There are still quite a few more reasons. Have you ever thought that your computer is slow? Often times, programming languages need to be compiled before they can be run, which is like converting it to symbols and numbers the computer can understand. Even these languages are super helpful and have good applications, this takes time, especially if you have that slow computer. By the end of your career, you'll be thinking "Ah crud. Just hurry up, would you?". With python this all changes. Instead of using a compiler, the python application will run the code as it is, giving you the option of quickly changing the code. This makes it a great, quick, language to learn. Finally, anyone can contribute to the python project. This means that everyday, there are more and more libraries to make your code work better. Python today is used to develop AI interfaces, as it handles data very well. Python is also used in web development with add-ons like flask or django. Did you know that Instagram was built off of python using django? Python is also used in a variety of creation apps like blender to help automation. This is why python is such a versatile coding language, and why we are going to teach it to you!
